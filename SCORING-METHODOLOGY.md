# Paradigm Shift Detection - Complete Scoring Methodology

## Overview

The Geopolitical Intelligence System uses a **weighted multi-factor scoring algorithm** to detect paradigm shifts in international relations. The risk score (0-100) combines four analysis components, each contributing to the overall assessment of paradigm stability.

---

## 📊 Risk Score Formula

```
Risk Score = (V × 0.25) + (T × 0.30) + (R × 0.25) + (E × 0.20)
```

**Where:**
- **V** = Currency Volatility Score (25% weight)
- **T** = Triangulation Score (30% weight)
- **R** = Resonance Score (25% weight)
- **E** = Economic Structure Score (20% weight)

**Score Range:** 0-100
- **Higher scores** = Higher risk, greater instability
- **Lower scores** = More stable paradigm

---

## 🔴 Component 1: Currency Volatility Analysis (Weight: 25%)

### Purpose
Detects extreme currency movements that indicate systemic instability and potential paradigm shifts in monetary systems.

### Scoring Rules

| Condition | Points | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| Volatility > 4σ | +85 | Critical systemic instability |
| Volatility > 3σ | +75 | High volatility indicating potential paradigm shift |
| Volatility > 2σ | +60 | Elevated volatility detected |
| Volatility ≤ 2σ | +0 | Stable currency conditions |

### Calculation
```
Volatility Score = (Average Volatility / 6σ) × 25
- Maximum: 25 points (100% of component)
- Minimum: 0 points
```

### Parameters Tracked
- **Currency Volatility**: Standard deviation from 6-month average (in σ units)
- **Exchange Rate**: Current exchange rate relative to USD
- **Volatility Trend**: Change in volatility over time

### What It Detects
- Currency devaluation patterns
- Exchange rate decoupling
- Monetary system stress
- Cross-border settlement disruptions
- Digital currency adoption impacts

## 🔵 Component 2: Triangulation Analysis (Weight: 30%)

### Purpose
Examines three-way relationships between economic indicators (GDP ↔ Inflation ↔ Exchange Rate) to detect pattern convergence, structural imbalances, or decoupling events.

### Scoring Rules

| Condition | Points | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| GDP-Inflation divergence > 5% | +20 | Structural imbalance in growth/inflation |
| Exchange-GDP decoupling > 10% | +15 | Exchange rate moving independently of GDP |
| Triangulation Score > 0.7 | +28 | High pattern convergence detected |
| Base triangulation score | 0-40 | From data triangulation metric |

### Calculation
```
Triangulation Score = Pattern Points + (Data Score × 40)
- Maximum: ~70 points (100% of component)
- Minimum: 0 points
```

### Parameters Tracked
- **GDP Growth**: Year-over-year percentage change
- **Inflation Rate**: Consumer price index change
- **Exchange Rate**: Currency value relative to baseline
- **Triangulation Score**: Calculated pattern convergence metric (0-1)
- **Meme Density**: Frequency of recurring patterns

### What It Detects
- Three-way indicator divergence
- Structural economic imbalances
- Pattern convergence or breakdown
- GDP decoupling from exchange rates
- Inflation-growth mismatches

### Meme Types Identified
- **PENETRATION**: Forces breaking through barriers (e.g., alternative currencies penetrating USD dominance)
- **WAVE**: Patterns spreading through systems (e.g., regionalization in trade)
- **TRIANGULATION**: Three-way relationship patterns forming
- **RESONANCE**: Phase alignment creating amplification

---

## 🟣 Component 3: Resonance Analysis (Weight: 25%)

### Purpose
Measures phase alignment (synchronization) across multiple economic indicators. Detects when indicators move in coordinated patterns, indicating paradigm-level shifts.

### Scoring Rules

| Condition | Points | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| Phase alignment > 80% | +20 | Strong synchronization across indicators |
| Resonance level > 60% | +15 | Moderate alignment detected |
| Resonance level ≤ 60% | +0 | No significant resonance |

### Calculation
```
Resonance Score = Alignment Points + (Resonance Level × 25)
- Maximum: 25 points (100% of component)
- Minimum: 0 points
```

### Parameters Tracked
- **Resonance Level**: Phase alignment metric (0-1) from data
- **Phase Alignment**: Synchronization coefficient across indicators
- **Phase State**: Current paradigm phase (Emergence, Growth, Peak, Decline, Collapsing)

### Phase States

| Phase | Description | Characteristics |
|-------|-------------|------------------|
| **EMERGENCE** | New patterns emerging | Early signs of new paradigms |
| **GROWTH** | Patterns amplifying | Acceleration of emerging trends |
| **PEAK** | Maximum intensity | Paradigm at full strength |
| **DECLINE** | Patterns waning | Old paradigm losing power |
| **COLLAPSING** | Old paradigm breaking down | Transition period active |
| **TRANSITION** | Between paradigms | Overlap of old and new |

### What It Detects
- Synchronized economic indicator movements
- Coordinated policy shifts across nations
- Regional resonance patterns
- Civilizational gradient alignment
- System-wide paradigm momentum

## 🟢 Component 4: Economic Structure Analysis (Weight: 20%)

### Purpose
Detects anomalies in economic structure including GDP growth, inflation extremes, unemployment trends, and debt levels that may indicate paradigm stress.

### Scoring Rules

| Condition | Points | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| GDP growth anomaly > 6% | +15 | Unusual growth rate (positive or negative) |
| Inflation > 15% (hyperinflation) | +30 | Currency collapse risk |
| Inflation > 10% (high) | +20 | Monetary stress detected |
| Inflation < -5% (deflation) | +20 | Deflationary pressure |
| Unemployment increase > 2% | +15 | Labor market stress |
| Debt/GDP > 90% | +5 | High debt burden |

### Calculation
```
Economic Score = Sum of all triggered conditions
- Maximum: ~20-30 points (100-150% of component, capped)
- Minimum: 0 points
```

### Parameters Tracked

## 📈 20-Year Projection Methodology

### Confidence Decay
```
Confidence(t) = max(Base Confidence - (t/T × 35), 40)

Where:
- t = years from present
- T = total projection horizon (20 years)
- Base Confidence = calculated risk score
- Floor = 40% (minimum confidence)
```

**Example:**
- Year 0 (today): 85% confidence
- Year 5: 76% confidence
- Year 10: 67% confidence
- Year 15: 59% confidence
- Year 20: 50% confidence

### GDP Growth Projection
Based on paradigm status:
- **COLLAPSING**: -0.5× growth multiplier (contraction)
- **SHIFTING**: +0.5× growth multiplier (slowed growth)
- **EMERGING**: +1.0× growth multiplier (accelerated growth)
- **STABLE**: +0.8× growth multiplier (moderate growth)

### Risk Factors by Projection Window

**Years 0-5:**
- Currency devaluation risk
- Trade disruption potential

**Years 5-10:**
- Long-term structural changes
- Geopolitical realignment
- Debt sustainability concerns

**Years 10-15:**
- Systemic transformation risk
